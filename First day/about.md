# Explanation of day one challenge 

The challenge for day one is to create an Expanding Cards component.

An Expanding Cards component is a user interface element that displays a set of cards, where each card can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide additional content. When a user clicks on a card, it expands to show more information, and when clicked again, it collapses to its original size.

To implement this, you would need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML would define the structure of the cards, including any additional content that should be hidden initially. The CSS would be used to style the cards and control their appearance, such as the size, color, and transitions. Finally, JavaScript would be used to handle the click events on the cards and toggle their expanded or collapsed state.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow

Define the HTML structure for the cards, including any additional content that should be hidden initially.
Use CSS to style the cards, including their size, color, and transitions.
Write JavaScript code to handle the click events on the cards.
In the JavaScript code, toggle the expanded or collapsed state of the clicked card.
Update the CSS styles of the clicked card to reflect its expanded or collapsed state.
By following these steps, you should be able to create an interactive Expanding Cards component that allows users to expand and collapse individual cards to view additional content.
