# Explanation of day one challenge 

The challenge for day one is to create an Expanding Cards component.

An Expanding Cards component is a user interface element that displays a set of cards, where each card can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide additional content. When a user clicks on a card, it expands to show more information, and when clicked again, it collapses to its original size.
